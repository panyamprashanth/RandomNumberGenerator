# RandomNumberGenerator
Create a Windows Forms application that has a button and a textbox.
• Every 100ms, the text box should show a random number between 0-9.
• When the user clicks the button, expand the random number range by 10 (i.e., after the first
click, the values should be between 0 and 19. After the second click, values should be between 0
and 29, etc.)
• The program should close automatically after 30 seconds.
